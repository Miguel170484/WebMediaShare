WebMediaShare is an app to browse your favourite media websites (e.g. online streaming sites, online radio stations, etc.) so that you can:

    - view the content without ads/popups/redirects/etc.
    - listen to music from a streaming site in a media player app like VLC, so that it continues playing even if the screen is off
    - send the media to your TV or Hifi (e.g. via the Kore app for Kodi). This works like Chromecast.
    - share the media URL to friends on chats or email
    - share the media to an app for downloading

WebMediaShare is a browser with the following features:

    - Save your favourite media sites in-app
    - Add shortcuts to the home screen so that they open like regular apps
    - Ad blocking
    - Prevents popups, popunders, and redirects
    - intercepts media within web pages, allowing you to view and share them
