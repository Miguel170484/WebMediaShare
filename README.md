WebMediaShare Android app
=========================

An app to bookmark and browse media-rich websites (e.g. Jango.com, YouTube.com, etc.) for the purpose of sharing the media for casting/sharing/downloading.

This app pairs well with Kore Remote app for Kodi, allowing you to browse for media on your phone, and then share it to your TV via Kore Remote to a Kodi player. This works like ChromeCast, but without the need for ChromeCast hardware, or any dependencies to Google services. It also works for many websites without the need for any specific support (e.g. apps or plugins for Kodi).
